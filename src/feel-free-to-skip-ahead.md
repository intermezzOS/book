# Feel free to skip ahead!

We're about to go on a journey together. However, there's no single way to
travel. You have two options here:

* Learn about some assembly code and exactly how things boot.
* Ignore all that and head straight into Rust.

Both ways are totally valid. Which way is "right" is up to you. If you'd like
to write each and every line of code yourself, then move on to the next
chapter. But if you're more excited about writing Rust code than dealing with
the arcane details of the `x86` platform, don't worry about skipping ahead to
"[A simple VGA driver]". The chapters up until then will be getting us from
nothing to a main function written in Rust, and this involves a bunch of
assembly programming that you may or may not find interesting. In fact, it's so
common that there's a convention in the hobbyist OS development community to
have a project called "bare bones" that sets up all of this stuff. So if you're
not interested in the assembly part, you can skip ahead, and not miss out on
a whole lot. The chapters up until then will be building up the bare bones, it's
the chapters after that that dive into more interesting things.

If you do decide to do this, visit [this page] and grab a copy of the bare
bones. You can then continue on with the tutorial, and things will be fine.
